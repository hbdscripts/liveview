# Deploy: wrangler deploy (from workers/ or with name workers/ingest-enrich.js)
# Set ORIGIN_URL in Cloudflare Worker settings (e.g. https://app.kexo.io)
#
# To filter all bots (Google, Bing, Merchant Center, etc.): set BLOCK_KNOWN_BOTS = "1"
# AND add a Request Header Transform Rule that sets x-lv-client-bot = 1 when cf.client.bot eq true.
# See docs/CLOUDFLARE_INGEST_SETUP.md.

# Route this Worker to your CF-proxied ingest hostname
# routes = [{ pattern = "ingest.kexo.io/api/ingest*", zone_name = "kexo.io" }]

[vars]
# ORIGIN_URL must be set in Worker Settings -> Variables (secret or plain)
# BLOCK_KNOWN_BOTS = "1" to block known/verified bots (Google, Bing, Merchant Center, etc.) at the edge
# INGEST_SECRET = same value as your app's INGEST_SECRET so the Worker can POST to /api/bot-blocked and the config panel shows "Bots blocked: X"
