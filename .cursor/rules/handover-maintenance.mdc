# Handover maintenance (always-on)

This repo uses `HANDOVER.txt` as the canonical “current state” handover for humans and future agents.

## Requirement

- If you change any **core path**, you MUST update `HANDOVER.txt` in the same commit.

## What counts as a “core path”

- New/changed **routes/endpoints** (Express routes, API contracts)
- New/changed **dashboard UX** (tabs, panels, tables, modals, fetch/refresh behaviour)
- New/changed **ingest payload** fields or derivation logic
- New/changed **DB schema/migrations/indexes**
- New/changed **auth/access** model (Shopify embed vs direct visit)
- New/changed **deployment/runtime** behaviour (Railway/GHA, pruning, env var expectations)
- Any change that materially shifts the **direction/roadmap** described in the handover

## Keep it useful

- Update the “Last updated” line and add a short entry under “Changelog”.
- Prefer accurate, actionable notes over long explanations.
