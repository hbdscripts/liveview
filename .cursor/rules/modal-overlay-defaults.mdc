# Modal overlays: dark by default

- All modal dialogs must use a dark backdrop by default.
- For Bootstrap modals, keep `.modal-backdrop` dark (black with strong opacity).
- For custom/fallback modals (manual show/hide), create a backdrop element that matches the dark overlay standard.
- Close behavior must always work via:
  - header close button (X),
  - clicking backdrop when allowed,
  - Escape key.
- If a specific modal needs different overlay intensity, use a modal-scoped CSS override; do not reduce the global default.
