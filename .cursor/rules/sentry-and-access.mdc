# Sentry and access in this project

- **When the user says "Sentry"** (e.g. "anything in Sentry?", "check Sentry", "look at errors"): always use the **user-sentry** MCP to query Sentry. Do **not** respond that Sentry is "not available" or that you cannot access it — you have access via MCP.
- **How to query**: Use MCP server **user-sentry**. Useful tools: `find_organizations`, `find_projects`, `search_issues`, `get_issue_details`. For this app the Sentry project is **Node** in organization **lee-cooper**; use **regionUrl** `https://de.sentry.io` when the tool accepts it.
- **Config**: Sentry is configured in this app: `server/config.js` (sentryDsn), `.env.example` (SENTRY_DSN), `config/APP_CONFIG.md`. Assume SENTRY_DSN is set in the deployment environment. Do not ask the user to paste errors from Sentry; use MCP to fetch issues and details.
