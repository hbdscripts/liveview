# Commit and project memory

- **Commit changes yourself**: When you make code or config changes in this project, commit them (stage, commit with a clear message). Do not tell the user to run git commands unless they asked you not to commit (e.g. "don't commit").
- **Always push after commit**: After every commit, **run `git push origin main` yourself** (or the current branch). Do not tell the user to push — do it in the same turn. Skip only if the user explicitly asked you not to push.
- **Never ask to push**: Do not ask "should I push?" or "would you like me to push?" — just push. Treat push as automatic. No confirmation required from the user.
- **User preference (persistent)**: Treat commit + push as required completion for implementation tasks. When work is done, stage relevant files, commit, and push in the same turn unless the user explicitly says not to.
- **Default delivery flow**: For implementation requests, start by syncing with `git pull --ff-only`, then commit + push. Do **not** run `railway up` — Railway auto-deploys from git; pushing to main is sufficient.
- **Railway DB_URL caveat**: In production `DB_URL` may point at `postgres.railway.internal` (internal DNS). `railway run ...` executes locally and **cannot** resolve that host. To run DB scripts, run them in the deployed container via `railway ssh -- <command>` or rely on startup migrations in `server/index.js`.
- **Update project memory/config**: When you establish a new convention, fix a recurring issue, or add something future agents should know (e.g. "Git is on PATH", "always run migrations on startup", "Railway vars must be on the service not only Shared Variables"), add or update it in project docs or this rules directory so future Cursor agents in this project remember it.
- **Production pruning**: `npm start` runs `scripts/prune-runtime-files.js` to remove non-runtime files (docs, scripts, workers, extensions, .cursor, .github, etc.) so they do not remain on the server.
