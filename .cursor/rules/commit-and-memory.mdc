# Commit and project memory

- **Commit changes yourself**: When you make code or config changes in this project, commit them (stage, commit with a clear message). Do not tell the user to run git commands unless they asked you not to commit (e.g. "don't commit").
- **Push when appropriate**: After committing, push to the remote if the user would benefit (e.g. they deploy from the same branch). If unsure, commit first; only push when it clearly matches the user's workflow (e.g. they use Railway/GitHub deploy).
- **Update project memory/config**: When you establish a new convention, fix a recurring issue, or add something future agents should know (e.g. "Git is on PATH", "always run migrations on startup", "Railway vars must be on the service not only Shared Variables"), add or update it in project docs or this rules directory so future Cursor agents in this project remember it.
