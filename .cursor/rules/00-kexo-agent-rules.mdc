# Kexo agent rules

See **AGENT_RULES.md** at repo root for full rules.

## Multi-agent safety (must follow)

- **Branch-by-default**: work on a topic branch.
  - **Default behavior: deploy automatically** once the task is complete: merge to `main` and push `main` (Railway will auto-deploy).
  - **Do not ask for deploy confirmation** unless the user has explicitly said “don’t deploy” for this task/session.
- **Never discard unknown changes**: do not use `git restore .`, `git checkout -- .`, or `git reset --hard` unless you are 100% sure you’re discarding only your own work.
- **Sync early**: `git fetch origin` before starting and before committing if other commits may have landed.
- **If anything changes unexpectedly**: stop, inspect (`git status`, `git diff`), and prefer `git stash -u` while investigating.

**Push proof (after every push):** run and paste:

```
git rev-parse HEAD
git branch --show-current
git ls-remote --heads origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

Remote ref must match HEAD.
